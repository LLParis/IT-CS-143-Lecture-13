        // Self-Check Problems:
        // Section 15.1: Simple ArrayIntList

        // 1. What is the difference between an array list’s size and its capacity?
        // What is the relationship between the two values? (Is one always larger or
        // smaller than the other, for instance?)
        // The difference between ArrayList's size and capacity is one. For example,
        // the size of an ArrayList may be 6 but its capacity is 7 because we account for 0.

        // 2. What fields must be included in the ArrayIntList class, and why is each
        // field important? Would the class still work correctly if we removed any of
        // these fields?

        // 3. Why does the list class use a toString method rather than a print method?

        // 4. We wrote the class to have public methods called size (to read the number
        // of elements of the list) and get (to access the element value at a specific
        // index).
        // Why is this approach better than declaring the fields (such as size) public?

        // 7. An element can be inserted at the beginning, middle, or end of an array
        // list.
        // Which of the three insertion points is the most computationally expensive,
        // and why? Which is the most expensive location to remove an element from the
        // list?

        // 8. Write methods called min and max that return the smallest and largest
        // values in the list respectively.
        // For example, if a variable called list stores [11, –7, 3, 42, 0, 14], the
        // call of list.min() should return –7 and the call of list.max() should return
        // 42. If the list is empty, the methods should throw an IllegalStateException.

        // Section 15.2: A More Complete ArrayIntList

        // 9. Describe the overall preconditions placed on the list class in this
        // section.
        // What assumptions do we make about how clients will use the list?

        // 10. What is the purpose of the checkIndex method?
        // Where is it called in the list class? Describe a way that the client can
        // utilize an ArrayIntList that will be caught by checkIndex.

        // 11. What is the purpose of the checkCapacity method?
        // Where is it called in the list class? Describe a way that the client can
        // utilize an ArrayIntList that will be caught by checkCapacity.

        // 12. Once we check thoroughly for preconditions in the code, what data
        // invariants can we now assume about the list?

        // 13. Why do we bother to add the contains, isEmpty, and remove methods to the
        // list class, when the client can already perform this same functionality with
        // the indexOf, size, and remove methods, respectively?

        // Exercises:
        // None
    }
